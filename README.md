# TypeScript Teamwork Assignment - JavaScript Alpha Aug'18

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) + High Quality Code (HQC) Project

## Project Description 

Design and implement an object-oriented application by choice. Here are some suggestions:
- A game:
    - The world can be fantasy, sci-fi, modern, etc
    - You may have one or more heroes, gaining experience, having skills, wearing items, etc
- A line-of-business application:
    - TODO list application, TODOs can have a deadline, priorities, types etc
    - Calendar application, keeping meetings with places and date, having notifications, etc
    - Social network, with different users, different roles, friend list, user information, chat between users, groups of users, etc

## General Requirements
Please define and implement the following assets in your project:

- Project management
    - Use a Kanban board to organize your work (Trello, for example)
    - Try to estimate each user story by writing down expected time, actual time and optionally story points.
    - Active team communication is the key to success!

- Program against abstraction not concrete classes (Use interfaces) 
- Follow all OOP principles
- Follow SOLID and strong cohesion and loose coupling
- At least one level of inheritance
- Adequate usage of polymorphism
- Abstract classes 
- Use enumeration
- Dependency inversion container (using InversifyJS)
    - Favor composition over inheritance
    - Introduce object lifetime management
    - Introduce convention based binding
- Lifetime management of the objects
- Write unit tests (At least 30 real unit test. Not including constructors!)
    - Non-isolated tests will be looked upon as **invalid**!
    - Each member must introduce **at least 10** unit tests that use **Jasmine** or any other framework (**Jest**) or set of libraries (**Mocha, Chai, Sinon**)

## Additional Requirements
If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:

- Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)
- Constants, generic types
- User interface (UI) – console, desktop, web, mobile or as you like it the most
- Be aware, that using the DOM could lead to tedious process of testing the code
    - Try to use it only in some of the modules. Test the others

## Non-Required Work

- Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose it to experience object-oriented modeling and OOP in a real-world project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with Git.

## Deliverables

- The complete source code.
- Brief documentation of your project in **.md**(markdown). It should provide the following information (in brief):
    - Team name and list of team members (with http://telerikacademy.com usernames)
    - Project purpose – what problem do you solve and how?
    - The URL of your Git repository
    - What problems did the application have before you started refactoring?
    - What design patterns have you used and why?
    - Any other information (optionally)
- Optionally provide a PowerPoint presentation designed for the project defense

## Private Defense

Each member will have to deliver a private defense of its work in front of the trainers. You will have around ~30 minutes for the following:

- Demonstrate the application
- Demonstrate the changed you have introduced during the refactoring
- Show the source code in the Git web-based source code browser.
- Show the commits logs to confirm that each team member has contributed.
- Answer a few questions that might or might not be from the technical questionnaire.

## Give Feedback about Your Teammates

You will be invited to provide feedback about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so **take it seriously and be honest**.
