TypeScript Teamwork Assignment - JavaScript Alpha Aug'18

Part 1 - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Project

Project Description
Design and implement an object-oriented application by choice. Here are some suggestions:

A game:

The world can be fantasy, sci-fi, modern, etc
You may have one or more heroes, gaining experience, having skills, wearing items, etc


A line-of-business application:

TODO list application, TODOs can have a deadline, priorities, types etc
Calendar application, keeping meetings with places and date, having notifications, etc
Social network, with different users, different roles, friend list, user information, chat between users, groups of users, etc




General Requirements
Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project:


The OOP principles (where applicable)

Inheritance
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Polymorphism



At least 5 interfaces (with one or more implementations)


At least 15 classes (implementing the application logic)


At least 3 abstract classes (with inheritors)


At least 1 custom exception class (with usage in your code)


At least 3 levels of depth in inheritance


At least 1 polymorphism usage


At least 1 enumeration


At least 1 design pattern (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command,  etc.)


You might read about design patterns in Wikipedia, Sourcemaking, DoFactory and others.

Additional Requirements

Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling
Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration


Optional Requirements
If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:

Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)
Constants, generic types
User interface (UI) – console, desktop, web, mobile or as you like it the most
Be aware, that using the DOM could lead to tedious process of testing the code


Part 2 - High Quality Code (HQC) Project

Project Description
Refactor and test the object-orientated application that you have developed during the previous weeks.
You should not introduce new behavior nor change the existing one!

General Requirements
Please define and implement the following in your project:


Dependency inversion container (using InversifyJS)

Favor composition over inheritance
Introduce object lifetime management
Introduce convention based binding



Unit tests

Non-isolated tests will be looked upon as invalid!
Each member must introduce at least 10 unit tests that use Jasmine or any other framework (Jest) or set of libraries (Mocha, Chai, Sinon)



Project management

Use a Kanban board to organize your work (Trello, for example)
Try to estimate each user story by writing down expected time, actual time and optionally story points.
Active team communication is the key to success!




Additional Requirements

Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling
Follow the best practices for SOLID design

Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use https://github.com/)


Non-Required Work

Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose it to experience object-oriented modeling and OOP in a real-world project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with Git.


Deliverables

The complete source code.
Brief documentation of your project in .md(markdown). It should provide the following information (in brief):

Team name and list of team members (with http://telerikacademy.com usernames)
Project purpose – what problem do you solve and how?
The URL of your Git repository
What problems did the application have before you started refactoring?
What design patterns have you used and why?
Any other information (optionally)


Optionally provide a PowerPoint presentation designed for the project defense


Private Defense
Each member will have to deliver a private defense of its work in front of the trainers. You will have around ~30 minutes for the following:

Demonstrate the application
Demonstrate the changed you have introduced during the refactoring
Show the source code in the Git web-based source code browser.
Show the commits logs to confirm that each team member has contributed.
Answer a few questions that might or might not be from the technical questionnaire.


Give Feedback about Your Teammates
You will be invited to provide feedback about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so take it seriously and be honest.
